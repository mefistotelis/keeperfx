--Setup Commands--
------------------

---This command tells the game how long to wait before generating a new creature for each player.
---The type of creatures that appear cannot be scripted and will depend on the rooms the player has built.
---This is a global setting and will apply to all Portals.
---@param interval integer The number of game turns between each creature.
function SET_GENERATE_SPEED(interval) end

---If you have placed down an enemy dungeon heart (not a hero dungeon heart), this command tells Dungeon Keeper that a computer player needs to be assigned.
---@param player playersingle
---@param attitude integer|"ROAMING"
function COMPUTER_PLAYER(player,attitude) end

---Sets up an alliance between two players.
---Note that computer players will not break the alliance by themselves, but human player may do so.
---So this command is mostly for controlling the computer players behavior.
---@param player1 playerrange players this should affect.
---@param player2 playersingle player this should affect.
---@param state? integer What happens to the alliance, it can have the following values:
--- 0: Players are enemies, but may change that. Computer Players never will.
--- 1: Players are allied, but may change that. Computer Players never will.
--- 2: Players are enemies, and cannot change this.
--- 3: Players are allied, and cannot change this.
function ALLY_PLAYERS(player1,player2,state) end

---How much gold each player has at the start of the level.
---@param player playerrange The number of game turns between each creature.
---@param gold integer The number of game turns between each creature.
function START_MONEY(player,gold) end

---The maximum number of creatures a player can have.
---The player can still gain creatures through Scavenging and Torturing but no more will come through the portal until the number of creatures drops below the maximum again.
---@param player playerrange The player name, e.g. PLAYER1. See players section for more information.
---@param max_amount integer The maximum number of creatures. This must be a number below 255.
function MAX_CREATURES(player,max_amount) end

---The creature pool is a set number of creatures that can be attracted by all the players.
---Imagine a large group of creatures waiting outside the Dungeon Area (all Portals share this group).
---A player puts down a room, e.g. a Torture Chamber, and a creature (Dark Mistress) is attracted. The Mistress is taken from this group. If there are no more Mistresses in the group then the player will not be able to gain any more unless he uses other means, e.g. scavenging.
---This is a first come, first serve system so players will need to hurry if they want to gain the rarest creatures.
---If a creature becomes angry, it will exit via an Portal and return to the pool. Dead creatures do not return to the pool so be careful the players do not run out.
---This command sets the number of creatures that are placed in this pool. If you leave any creatures off the list then they will not appear in the pool.
---@param creature_type creature_type The creature's name, e.g. BILE_DEMON.
---@param amount integer The number of creature's of that type in the pool.
function ADD_CREATURE_TO_POOL(creature_type,amount) end

---@param player playerrange The player’s name, e.g. PLAYER1. See players section for more information.
---@param creature_type creature_type The creature’s name, e.g. SORCEROR. See creature names section for more information.
---@param can_be_attracted boolean This value should always be set to true. Creatures, unlike spells and rooms, do not have to be pre-enabled.
---@param amount_forced integer Amount of creatures of that kind which can be force-attracted (attracted even if player doesn't have rooms required by that creature). Originally there was no possibility to skip attraction conditions.
function CREATURE_AVAILABLE(player,creature_type,can_be_attracted,amount_forced) end

---Normally, when a creature dies, and its body vanishes, it is added to the creature pool again.
---This command allows you to ensure that all dead creatures are dead forever.
---@param return_to_pool boolean Logic value to control the creatures returning after death. The default value is true, allowing dead creatures to come through portal again. Setting it to 0 will prevent dead creatures from returning.
function DEAD_CREATURES_RETURN_TO_POOL(return_to_pool) end

---This command tells the game that a specific room is available for the player to place down.
---@param player playerrange The players the room should be made available for.
---@param room room_type The room’s name, e.g. TEMPLE.
---@param can_be_available boolean If it is true then you are telling the game that the room may be researched at some point.
---@param is_available boolean If it is true then the room is available straight away. If it is false then the room cannot become available until it is set to 1 or it is researched.
function ROOM_AVAILABLE(player,room,can_be_available,is_available) end


---This command tells the game that a specific spell is available for the player to cast.
---@param player playerrange The player’s name, e.g. PLAYER1. See players section for more information.

function MAGIC_AVAILABLE(player,spell,can_be_available,is_available) end

---This command tells the game that a specific trap is available for the player to construct.
---@param player playerrange The player’s name, e.g. PLAYER1. See players section for more information.
---@param trap trap_type The trap’s name, e.g. LAVA. See doors/traps names section for more information.
---@param can_be_available boolean If it is true then you are telling the game that the trap may be constructed at some point.
---@param number_available integer The number of doors available to the player at the start of the level or when they become available. Bear in mind that without a Workshop, the traps cannot be armed. This may cause problems in the game. It is best to leave this at 0 when you write your scripts.
function TRAP_AVAILABLE(player,trap,can_be_available,number_available) end

---This command tells the game that a specific door is available for the player to construct.
---@param player playerrange The player’s name, e.g. PLAYER1. See players section for more information.
---@param door door_type The door’s name, e.g. BRACED. See doors/traps names section for more information.

function SET_TIMER(player,timer) end

function ADD_TO_TIMER() end
function DISPLAY_TIMER() end
function HIDE_TIMER() end
---Sets time to be displayed on "bonus timer" - on-screen time field, used mostly for bonus levels.
---But now this command can be used to show bonus timer in any level, and may show clocktime instead of turns.
---Setting game turns to 0 will hide the timer.
---@param turns integer The amount of game turns the timer will count down from. That's 20 per second.
---@param clocktime? integer Set to 1 to display the countdown in hours/minutes/seconds. Set to 0 or don't add the param to display turns.

---@param head_for head_for This command tells the Tunneller what it is tunnelling to.
---@param target integer This command will tell the Tunneller which Action Point (if the head for command was ACTION_POINT) or Player (if the head for command was DUNGEON or DUNGEON_HEART) to go to.
---If the command was APPROPIATE_DUNGEON then this will just be 0 as the APPROPIATE_DUNGEON command sends the Tunneller to the dungeon of the player with the highest score. If you wish to put player here, you must type player number, like 1, not player name. If you will type PLAYER1, the game won't be able to recognize the number and will treat it as 0.
---@param experience integer The experience level of the Tunneller.
---@param gold integer The amount of gold the Tunneller is carrying.
---@return Creature
function ADD_TUNNELLER_TO_LEVEL(owner,spawn_location,head_for,target,experience,gold) return Creature end

---@param countdown integer Number of game turns before the leader of the party start moving to the objective. Even if this is set to zero, there usually is a little delay (approx. 200 game turns) before the leader starts moving.
function ADD_TO_PARTY(party_name,creaturemodel,level,gold,objective,countdown) end

---@param party_name string The name as defined with the CREATE_PARTY command
---@param creaturemodel creature_type
---@param level integer
function DELETE_FROM_PARTY(party_name,creaturemodel,level) end

---This adds a specified party of creatures to the level with a Tunneller Dwarf as it’s leader.
---The Tunneller will immediately dig to it’s target and the other creatures will follow.
---@param owner playersingle owner of the creature
---@param party_name string The name as defined with the CREATE_PARTY command
---@param spawn_location location where the party should be spawned
---@param head_for head_for This command tells the Tunneller what it is tunnelling to. one of these options ACTION_POINT,DUNGEON,DUNGEON_HEART,APPROPIATE_DUNGEON
---@param target integer This command will tell the Tunneller which Action Point (if the head for command was ACTION_POINT) or Player (if the head for command was DUNGEON or DUNGEON_HEART) to go to.
---If the command was APPROPIATE_DUNGEON then this will just be 0 as the APPROPIATE_DUNGEON command sends the Tunneller to the dungeon of the player with the highest score.

function ADD_TUNNELLER_PARTY_TO_LEVEL(owner,party_name,spawn_location,head_for,target,experience,gold) end

---Very similar to the ADD_TUNNELLER_PARTY_TO_LEVEL command, this adds a party to the level but does not include a Tunneller Dwarf.
---This means the party will not be able to tunnel to their target.
---@param owner playersingle
---@param party_name string The name as defined with the CREATE_PARTY command
---@param location location where the party should be spawned
---@param ncopies integer
function ADD_PARTY_TO_LEVEL(owner,party_name,location,ncopies) end
